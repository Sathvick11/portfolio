This enabled to provide the developers with their latest changes immediately after the commit.</li> <li>The input files are stored in a docker container in OpenShift. These files are later used by the framework, when required, via FastAPI.</li> <li>By implementing the framework, the developers were able to save time on integration testing of modules from 20-30 minutes to 10-20 seconds.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"#devops-intern","title":"DevOps Intern","text":"<p>Robert Bosch GmbH, Schwieberdingen, Germany August 2024 - February 2024</p> <ul> <li>Developed a data visual dashboard using Python to provide insights into the open issues and tasks in Jira and Confluence. This provided data driven insights into the project performance and records.</li> <li>Created and maintained CI/CD pipelines in Windows and Linux environments using GitHub Actions. This ensured smooth integration of the code and automated test processes.</li> <li>Implemented automated testing in simulations such as ANSYS, PSpice and MATLAB using Python and Batch scripting.</li> <li>Management of user accounts and permissions in cloud-hosted tools, ensuring secure and efficient access for team members.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"#student-assistant","title":"Student Assistant","text":"<p>THWS, Schweinfurt, Germany October 2022 - March 2023</p> <ul> <li>Worked as a Python Developer for a research project - KoPro, which mainly focuses on the development of interaction between robots and humans in the workplace.</li> <li>The goal of the project was to build a simple DUPLO brick model using a Kuka robot. For the robot to grip the bricks, it needs to know the dimensions of the bricks.  </li> <li>Developed an algorithm in Python to extract the data of the DUPLO blocks such as length, width, and height and physical properties such as inertia, mass and center of gravity from CAD files.</li> <li>The extracted data was later stored in MongoDB and used by the robot to grip the bricks. </li> </ul>"},{"location":"#education","title":"Education","text":""},{"location":"#mechatronics-beng","title":"Mechatronics (B.Eng)","text":"<p>Technical University of Applied Sciences W\u00fcrzburg-Schweinfurt, Schweinfurt, Germany  October 2020 - February 2025</p> <p>Main Courses:</p> <ul> <li>Applied Machine Learning and Design of Experiments</li> <li>Object Oriented Programming and Software Engineering</li> <li>Cryptogrpahy and Ethical Hacking</li> <li>Hardware Description Languages and Embedded Systems</li> <li>Control Systems</li> </ul>"},{"location":"#skills","title":"Skills","text":"<ul> <li>Programming Languages:      Python, C++, Batch Scripting, YAML, SystemVerilog, HTML, CSS, MATLAB, LaTeX</li> <li>Tools:  Git, Docker, JIRA, Confluence, VSCode, OpenShift, REST API, CI/CD</li> <li>Simulation Tools:  Ansys optiSLang, Simulink, PSpice, Fusion360, PTC Creo</li> </ul>"},{"location":"#contact","title":"Contact","text":"<p>You can also find me on</p> <p> </p>"},{"location":"projects/artist-insight-hub/","title":"Artist Insight Hub","text":""},{"location":"projects/artist-insight-hub/#artist-insight-hub","title":"Artist Insight Hub","text":"<p>A web application that provides insights into artists, their discography, and their popularity.</p>"},{"location":"projects/cinespherex/","title":"CinesphereX","text":""},{"location":"projects/cinespherex/#cinesphere","title":"CineSphere","text":"<p>A web application that provides insights into desired movies.</p>"},{"location":"projects/resistor-reel-cutter-machine/","title":"Resistor Reel Cutter Machine","text":""},{"location":"projects/resistor-reel-cutter-machine/#resistor-reel-cutter-machine","title":"Resistor Reel Cutter Machine","text":"<p>A machine that automates the cutting of desired number of reel components.</p>"}]}
